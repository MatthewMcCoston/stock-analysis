    When comparing the outcomes of the two years, 2017 DQ had massive gains of almost 200%; however, the following year the little over half of their total value. Which indicates that the stalk is not quite a stable company due to the fact that they had massive gains and semi heavy losses. However if they were to invest in the company with the ticker id ENPH the showed two years of almost the same amount of growth, which indicates that they are a stable company and would continue to see gains.

    The original codes ran in about 0.52 seconds for both of the young years however with filtering out the unneeded information the refactored codes now run at 0.12 seconds. Which is significantly faster. 
#### Advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code and how do the pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
    The benefits of refactoring a code is it gets rid of all of the clutter that may occurred from the original code. Also by decluttering the code and simplifying it, the over all run time of the code can be decreased. With  refactoring the code for this module it is now easier to examine more of the macro due to its over size shrinking. The original code runs almost 5 times slower than the refactored code which if there was more information provided could be the difference between 30 seconds and a 1 minute and a half. 

    The disadvantages of refactoring code can be that the new while changing the code to a simpler form you can create bugs due to the changing of variables and arrays. Which leads to the other disadvantage is that the refactoring process does the same code uncluttered code did. The refactored code now includes less space overall the overall code has gotten more complex. Which made figuring out the errors that occurred harder due to the felt to be more vague. For instance, an error I ran into was a range error on the part of the code that defined where the output would go. This caused me to recheck all of my code 4 times before figuring out that it was due to the fact that I had not defined the cells that were needing to be filled in.
